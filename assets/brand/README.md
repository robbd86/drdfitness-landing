# DRD Fitness Brand Assets

Place the new DRD Fitness logo files in this folder.

Expected filenames (recommended):
- `logo.jpg` — full DRD Fitness logo

Notes:
- If your JPG has a solid background, ensure it looks good on the site’s dark background.
- The logo is rendered in the header as an `<img>` wrapped in a link back to `/`.
- If you want a mobile-only mark/icon later, add `mark.svg` and we can switch to it on small screens.
