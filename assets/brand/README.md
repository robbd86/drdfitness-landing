# DRD Fitness Brand Assets

Place the new DRD Fitness logo files in this folder.

Expected filenames (recommended):
- `logo.svg` (preferred) — full DRD Fitness logo, transparent background
- `logo.png` (fallback if needed)

Notes:
- Transparent background is recommended so it works on the site’s dark background.
- The logo is rendered in the header as an `<img>` wrapped in a link back to `/`.
- If you want a mobile-only mark/icon later, add `mark.svg` and we can switch to it on small screens.
